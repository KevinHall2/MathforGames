# MathforGames
This project contains a math library that overloads and overrides functions and struct properties from the pre-existing System.Numerics math library for the purpose of calculations and transformations with 3x3 Matrixes, 4x4 Matrixes, 2 point Vectors, 3 point Vectors, and 4 point Vectors. This library is provided as a .dll file, and is a dynamic library that will have to be linked into your project for it to funciton.


Download the .zip file at https://github.com/KevinHall2/MathforGames/releases and extract its contents to a folder that will help facilitate linking the .dll file into your project.
